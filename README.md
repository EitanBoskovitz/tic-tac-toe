# tic-tac-toe

====== HOW TO RUN ======
1. clone the project
2. cd into client folder and run npm start
3. cd into server folder and run node index.js

===== WHAT I TRIED TO MAKE ======
1. create a sign up and sign in with auth to differentiate between different    users using cookies and StreamChat api.
2. I couldnt figure out in my remaining time why the "queryUsers" does not return any users.
3. I hoped I could build the simple tic tac toe game based on the React tutorial, but couldn't finish due to time constraints
